Differences between strongly typed languages and weakly typed languages 

strongly typed language : strongly typed language, also known as strongly typed definition language, 
is a language that always forces type definition. It requires that the use of variables must strictly conform to the definition, 
and all variables must be defined before use. Languages such as Java and C ++ are mandatory type definitions, 
that is, once a variable is specified as a data type, it will always be the data type if it is not forcibly converted. For example, 
if you have an integer that is not explicitly converted, you cannot treat it as a string. 


weak type language : weak type language is also called weak type definition language, which is opposite to strong type definition.
JavaScript language belongs to weak type language. Simple understanding is a language in which variable types can be ignored.
For example, if the JavaScript is defined as a weak type, you can connect the string '12' with the integer 3 in the JavaScript to obtain the string '123 ',
which is forcibly converted when added. 


Comparison between the two: strong language may be slightly inferior to weak language in speed, but the rigor brought by strong language can effectively help avoid many mistakes
