What built-in objects do JavaScript have?

global objects (global objects), or standard built-in objects, should not be confused with global objects (global object). 
The global object mentioned here is the objects in the global scope. 
Other objects in the global scope can be created by user scripts or provided by the host program.

Classification of standard built-in objects: 

(1)value attributes. These global attributes return a simple value. These values do not have their own attributes and methods. 
   For example, Infinity, NaN, undefined, and null literal values
   
(2)function properties. Global functions can be called directly without specifying the object to which they belong during the call. 
   After the call is completed, the result is directly returned to the caller.
   For example, eval()、parseFloat()、parseInt() 
   
(3)Basic objects, which are the basis for defining or using other objects. Basic objects include general objects, function objects, and error objects.
   For example, Object, Function, Boolean, Symbol, and Error.

(4)numbers and date objects, which are used to represent numbers, dates and objects to perform mathematical calculations.
   For example, Number, Math, and Date

(5)string, used to represent and manipulate the object of the string.
   For example, String and RegExp 

(6)indexable collection objects, which represent data collections sorted by index values, including arrays and type arrays, as well as objects with class array structure.
   For example, Array

(7)collection objects that use keys. These collection objects use keys when storing data. You can iterate elements in the insertion order.
   For example, Map, Set, WeakMap, and WeakSet 

(8)vector set, the data in SIMD vector set will be organized into a data sequence.
   For example,SIMD

(9)structured data. These objects are used to represent and manipulate structured buffer data or JSON-encoded data. 
   For example, JSON 

(10)control ab  stract objects
    For example, Promise and Generator

(11)reflection 
    for example, Reflect and Proxy

(12)nternationalization, adding ECMAScript objects to support multi-language processing. 
    Such as Intl and Intl.Collator
    
(13）WebAssembly

(14)for example, arguments 

summary: 
built-in objects in js mainly refer to some global value attributes,
functions defined by js and constructor objects used to instantiate other objects that exist in the global scope before the program is executed. 
Commonly used such as global variable values NaN and undefined, 
global functions such as parseInt() and parseFloat() are used to instantiate Object constructors such as Date and Object, 
and single built-in objects such as Math objects that provide mathematical calculations.
