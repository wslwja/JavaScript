// Given an input of array, 
// which is made of items with >= 3 properties

let items = [
  {color: 'red', type: 'tv', age: 18}, 
  {color: 'silver', type: 'phone', age: 20},
  {color: 'blue', type: 'book', age: 17}
] 

// an exclude array made of key value pair
const excludes = [ 
  {k: 'color', v: 'silver'}, 
  {k: 'type', v: 'tv'}, 
  ...
] 

function excludeItems(items, excludes) { 
  excludes.forEach( pair => { 
    items = items.filter(item => item[pair.k] === item[pair.v])
  })
 
  return items
}

1. What does this function excludeItems do?
   The purpose of this code is to filter an array of objects based on the excludes parameter passed in.
   During the filtering process, an excludeMap is created to store key-value pairs that need to be excluded.
   Then, the filter function will traverse the items array and check whether the key-value pair of each object meets the conditions according to excludeMap.
   If the condition is met, the object is retained in the result array. Finally, return the filtered result array

2. Is this function working as expected ?
   items = items.filter(item => item[pair.k] === item[pair.v])
   Because it is excluded, so we have to judge incomplete, so use!

3. What is the time complexity of this function?
   The time complexity of this function is O(n^2) in the worst case, where n is the number of items in the input array.
   This is because the filter function iterates through each item in the input array, and for each item, it checks the keys of each object in the input array.
   If the input array is large, this can result in a slow performance.

4. How would you optimize it ?
   function excludeItems(items, excludes) { 
      const excludeMap = new Map()
      for (let {k, v} of excludes) {
        if (!excludeMap.has(k)) {
          excludeMap. set(k, new Set())
        }
        excludeMap. get(k).add(v)
      }
      return items.filter(item => {
        return Object.keys(item).every(
          key => !excludeMap.has(key) || !excludeMap.get(key).has(item[key])
        )
      })
    }
