Why do JavaScript need to upgrade variables and what problems does it cause?

Variable promotion shows that variables declared wherever they are in the function seem to be promoted to the beginning of the function and can be accessed before variable declaration without reporting errors. 

The essential reason the js engine has a parsing process before code execution, creates an execution context, 
and initializes some objects needed for code execution. When a variable is accessed, it is searched in the scope chain of the current execution context. 
The beginning of the scope chain points to the variable object of the current execution context. This variable object is an attribute of the execution context. 
It contains formal parameters of functions, all functions, and variable declarations. This object is created during code parsing. 

First of all, when JS gets a variable or a function, it has two steps, namely parsing and executing.

in the parsing phase , JS checks the syntax and precompiles the function. When parsing, a global execution context is created. 
First, the variables and function declarations to be executed in the code are taken out. 
The variables are assigned to undefined first, and the functions are declared to be available. Before a function is executed, 
a function execution context is also created, which is similar to the global execution context. However, 
this, arguments, and function parameters are added to the function execution context. 

global Context: variable definition, function declaration 

function context: variable definition, function declaration, this,arguments

in the execution phase , that is, the code is executed in sequence. 

Then why do we upgrade variables? There are two main reasons:

improve performance 

better fault tolerance

（1）improve performance

Before JS code is executed, syntax checks and precompilation are performed, and this operation is performed only once. 
This is to improve performance. Without this step, the variable (function) must be parsed again before each code execution. 
This is unnecessary because the code of the variable (function) does not change. It is enough to parse it again. 

Precompiled code is also generated for the function during parsing. During precompilation,
it counts which variables are declared and which functions are created, and compresses the code of the function to remove comments and unnecessary blanks. 
The advantage of this is that you can directly allocate stack space for the function every time you execute the function (you do not need to parse it again to obtain which variables are declared in the code and which functions are created), 
and the code execution is faster due to code compression.

（2）better fault tolerance 

variable enhancement can improve JS fault tolerance to a certain extent. See the following code:

  a = 1;
  var a;
  console.log(a);

If there is no variable upgrade, the two lines of code will report an error. However, with the variable upgrade, the code can be executed normally. 

Although writing like this can be completely avoided during the development process, sometimes the code is very complicated. It may be used first and then defined due to negligence, 
which will not affect normal use. Because the variable is promoted, it will run normally.

Summary:
declaration improvements during parsing and precompilation can improve performance, allowing functions to allocate stack space for variables in advance during execution.

declaration improvement can also improve the fault tolerance of JS code, so that some non-standard code can also be executed normally. 

Although variable promotion has some advantages, it also causes some problems. In ES6, let and const are proposed to define variables, 
so there is no mechanism for variable promotion. Let's take a look at the possible problems caused by variable upgrade:

  var tmp = new Date();
  
  function fn(){
      console.log(tmp);
      if(false){
          var tmp = 'hello world';
      }
  }
  
  fn();  // undefined

  In this function, the tmp variable of the outer layer was originally printed. However, due to the problem of variable promotion, 
  the tmp defined by the inner layer was mentioned to the top of the function, which is equivalent to covering the tmp of the outer layer. Therefore, the printed result is undefined.

    var tmp = 'hello world';
    
    for (var i = 0; i < tmp.length; i++) {
        console.log(tmp[i]);
    }
    
    console.log(i); // 11

Because the I variable defined during the period is upgraded to a global variable, it will not be destroyed after the function ends, so it is printed out 11.
