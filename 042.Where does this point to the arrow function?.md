Where does this point to the arrow function?

Arrow function is different from traditional JavaScript function, arrow function does not belong to its own this, 
its so-called this is to capture the this value of its context, as its own this value, and because there is no own this,
so it will not be called by new. this so-called this will not be changed.

It can be understood with Babel.

// ES6 
const obj = { 
  getArrow() { 
    return () => { 
      console.log(this === obj); 
    }; 
  } 
}

After conversion:

var obj = { 
   getArrow: function getArrow() { 
     var _this = this; 
     return function () { 
        console.log(_this === obj); 
     }; 
   } 
}
