What are the methods of object inheritance? 

(1) The first method is to implement inheritance in the way of prototype chain,
but the disadvantage of this implementation method is that when data of reference type is contained, 
it will be shared by all instance objects, which is easy to cause modification confusion. In addition, you cannot pass parameters to supertypes when creating subtypes.

(2) The second method is to use the method of borrowing Constructors. 
This method is implemented by calling hyper-type constructors in subtype functions. 
This method solves the disadvantage that parameters cannot be passed to hyper-types. However, 
one of its problems is that function methods cannot be reused, and the method subtypes defined by the hyper-type prototype cannot be accessed. 

(3) The third method is combination inheritance, which is a way to combine prototype chains and borrowing constructors.
You can use constructors to inherit attributes of a type, and set a subtype prototype to a supertype instance. 
This method solves the problem when the above two modes are used alone. However, because we use a superclass instance as the subtype prototype,
we call the superclass constructor twice, resulting in many unnecessary attributes in the subtype prototype.

(4) The fourth method is the original type inheritance. The main idea of the original type inheritance is to create a new object based on the existing object. 
The implementation principle is to pass an object into the function and then return an object based on this object.
The main idea of this inheritance is not to create a new type, but to implement a simple inheritance of an Object.
The Object.create() method defined in ES5 is the implementation of the original type inheritance. The disadvantage is the same as that of the prototype chain.

(5) The fifth method is parasitic inheritance. The idea of parasitic inheritance is to create a function to encapsulate the inheritance process. 
By passing in an object, copying a copy of the object, extending the object, and finally returning the object.
This extension process can be understood as an inheritance.
The advantage of this inheritance is to inherit a simple object if the object is not of a custom type.
The disadvantage is that there is no way to reuse functions. 

(6) the sixth method is parasitic combination inheritance. 
The disadvantage of combination inheritance is that superclass instances are used as subtype prototypes, resulting in the addition of unnecessary prototype attributes. 
The way of parasitic combination inheritance is to use a copy of the supertype prototype as a subtype prototype, thus avoiding the creation of unnecessary attributes.
