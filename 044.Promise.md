In my work, I often encounter such A requirement. For example, after I use ajax to send A request A,
I get the data after success, and I need to pass the data to the request B;
Then I need to write the following code:

  let fs = require('fs')
  fs.readFile('./a.txt','utf8',function(err,data){
    fs.readFile(data,'utf8',function(err,data){
      fs.readFile(data,'utf8',function(err,data){
        console.log(data)
      })
    })
  })

The preceding code has the following disadvantages:

the latter request depends on the data passing down after the previous request is successful, which causes multiple ajax requests to be nested and the code is not intuitive enough. 

if the first and second requests do not need to pass parameters, the next request needs to be executed after the previous request succeeds. 
In this case, the code needs to be written as above, resulting in insufficient intuitive code.

Promise after it appears, the code becomes as follows:

  let fs = require('fs')
  function read(url){
    return new Promise((resolve,reject)=>{
      fs.readFile(url,'utf8',function(error,data){
        error && reject(error)
        resolve(data)
      })
    })
  }
  read('./a.txt').then(data=>{
    return read(data) 
  }).then(data=>{
    return read(data)  
  }).then(data=>{
    console.log(data)
  })

In this way, the code looks much simpler and solves the problem of Hell callback.
